      "question": "Glucose when heated with CH₃OH in presence of dry HCl gas gives α and β-methyl glucosides because it contains --------",
      "answers": {
        "a": "–CH₂OH group",
        "b": "a ring structure",
        "c": "an aldehyde group",
        "d": "Five hydroxyl groups"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The –CH₂OH group is part of the structure, but not the reason for glucoside formation.",
        "b": "Correct. The ring structure enables hemiacetal formation with methanol.",
        "c": "The aldehyde group is involved in oxidation, not glucoside formation.",
        "d": "Hydroxyl groups are reactive, but ring structure is key for glucosides."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

      "question": "Glucose gives silver mirror with Tollen's reagent. It shows the presence of -----------",
      "answers": {
        "a": "an alcoholic group",
        "b": "a ketonic group",
        "c": "an acidic group",
        "d": "an aldehydic group"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Alcoholic groups do not give Tollen's test.",
        "b": "Ketones generally don't respond to Tollen’s reagent.",
        "c": "Acids are not detected with Tollen’s reagent.",
        "d": "Correct. Tollen's test detects aldehyde groups."

      "question": "The structure pictured is the Haworth structure of ………",
      "answers": {
        "a": "beta-D-glucose",
        "b": "beta-D-galactose",
        "c": "alpha-D-galactose",
        "d": "alpha-D-glucose"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "beta-D-glucose is commonly shown in Haworth forms; likely correct if image was shown.",
        "b": "Galactose differs in configuration at C4 from glucose.",
        "c": "Incorrect alpha anomer assumed without image.",
        "d": "Alpha and beta differ in OH orientation at anomeric carbon."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct molecular formula for methylene blue.",
        "b": "Incorrect, missing sulfur atom.",
        "c": "Incorrect, has one extra chlorine atom.",
        "d": "Incorrect, nitrogen count is off."
